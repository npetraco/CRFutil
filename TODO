1. JAGS poisson

2. loo work flow
    MLE analogue??

3. Simulator
    study drop out rates for individual categories
    are dropouts correlated?
    do drop out rates vary, Think about bout Poisson lambda and Bernoulli p models. Try both Bayes and Freq ests



Hamiltonian matrix for graph? (records energy "parts": node energies (diagonal)
 and between pair node energies conected by an edge (off diagonal elements))
Density matrix? -Always diagonal?
vonNeumann entropy
correlation functions?
